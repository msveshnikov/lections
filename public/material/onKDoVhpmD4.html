<p><span>Bones of the skull: the neurocranium (the portion of the skull that surrounds and protects the brain) or the viscerocra-nium (i. e., the skeleton of the face). Bones of the neurocranium Frontal, Parietal, Temporal, Occipital, Ethmoid, Sphenoid.</span></p>
<p><span>Bones of the viscerocranium (surface): Maxilla, Nasal, Zygomatic, Mandible. Bones of the viscerocranium (deep): Ethmoid, Sphenoid, Vomer, Lacrimal, Palatine, Inferior nasal concha. Articulations: Most skull bones meet at immovable joints called sutures. The coronal suture is between the frontal and the parietal bones The sagittal suture is between two parietal bones. The lambdoid suture is between the parietal and the occipital bones. The bregma is the point at which the coronal suture intersects the sagittal suture</span></p>
<p><span>The lambda is the point at which the sagittal suture intersects the lambdoid suture. The pterion is the point on the lateral aspect of the skull where the greater wing of the sphenoid, parietal, frontal, and temporal bones converge. The temporomandibular joint is between the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone and the condylar process of the mandible.</span></p>
<p><span>The parotid gland is the largest of the salivary glands. Structures found within the substance of this gland include the following: Motor branches of the facial nerve CN VII enters the parotid gland after emerging from the stylomastoid foramen at the base of the skull. Superficial temporal artery and vein. The artery is a terminal branch of the external carotid artery.</span></p>
<p><span>Retromandibular vein, which is formed from the maxillary and superficial temporal veins.</span></p>
<p><span>Great auricular nerve, which is a cutaneous branch of the cer vical plexus. Auriculotemporal nerve, which is a sensory branch of V3. It supplies the TMJ and conveys postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the otic ganglion to the parotid gland Parotid (Stensen s) duct, which enters the oral cavity at the level of the maxillary second molar. The facial artery</span></p>
<p><span>is a branch of the external carotid artery in the neck. It</span></p>
<p><span>terminates as the angular artery near the bridge of the nose.</span></p>
