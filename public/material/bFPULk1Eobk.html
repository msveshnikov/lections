<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Granulopoiesis is the process of granulocyte formation. Bone marrow stem cells differentiate into all three types of granulocytes.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Myeloblast is a cell that has a large spherical nucleus containing delicate euchromatin and several nucleoli. It has a basophilic cytoplasm and no granules. Myeloblasts divide differentiate to form smaller promyelocytes.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Promyelocyte is a cell that contains a large spherical indented nucleus with coarse condensed chromatin. The cytoplasm is basophilic and contains peripheral azurophi-lic granules.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Myelocyte is the last cell in this series capable of division. The nucleus becomes increasingly heterochromatic with subsequent divisions. Specific granules arise from the Golgi apparatus, resulting in neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic myelocytes.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Metamyelocyte is a cell whose indented nucleus exhibits lobe formation that is characteristic of the neutrophil, eos-inophil, or basophil. The cytoplasm contains azurophilic granules and increasing numbers of specific granules. This cell does not divide. Granulocytes are the definitive cells that enter the blood. Neutrophilic granulocytes exhibit an intermediate stage called the band neutrophil. This is the first cell of this series to appear in the peripheral blood.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">It has a nucleus shaped like a curved rod or band.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Bands normally constitute 0,5&ndash;2&nbsp;% of peripheral WBCs; they subsequently mature into definitive neutrophils.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Agranulopoiesis is the process of lymphocyte and mono-cyte for mation. Lymphocytes develop from bone marrow stem cells (lymphoblasts). Cells develop in bone marrow and seed the secondary lymphoid organs (e. g., tonsils, lymph nodes, spleen). Stem cells for T cells come from bone marrow, develop in the thymus and, subsequently, seed the secondary lym phoid organs.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Promonocytes differentiate from bone marrow stem cells (monoblasts) and multiply to give rise to monocytes.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Monocytes spend only a short period of time in the marrow before being released into the bloodstream.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Monocytes are transported in the blood but are also found in connective tissues, body cavities and organs.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Outside the blood vessel wall, they are transformed into macrophages of the mononuclear phagocyte system.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Thrombopoiesis, or the formation of platelets, occurs in the red bone marrow.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Megakaryoblast is a large basophilic cell that contains a U-shaped or ovoid nucleus with prominent nucleoli. It is the last cell that undergoes mitosis.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Megakaryocytes are the largest of bone marrow cells, with diameters of 50 mm or greater. They undergo 4&ndash;5 nuclear divi sions without concomitant cytopla-smic division. As a result, the megakaryocyte is a cell with polylobulated, polyploid nucleus and abundant granules in its cytoplasm. As megakaryocyte maturation proceeds, &laquo;curtains&raquo; of platelet demarcation vesicles form in the cytoplasm. These vesicles coalesce, become tubular, and eventually form platelet demarcation membranes. These membranes fuse to give rise to the membranes of the platelets.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">A single megakaryocyte can shed (i. e., produce) up to 3,500 platelets.</span></p><div class="fb2-subtitle" style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 27px;"><span style="font-size:20px">New words</span></div><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">capable &ndash; способный</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">spherical &ndash; сферический</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">indented &ndash; зазубренный</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">chromatin &ndash; хроматин</span></p>
