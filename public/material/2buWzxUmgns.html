<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Bone tissue consists largely of a hard substance called the matrix. Embedded in the matrix are the bone cells, or osteocytes. Bone matrix consists of both organic and inorganic materials. The organic portion is made up chiefly of collagen fibres. The inorganic portion of matrix constitutes about two thirds of a bone&#39;s total weight. The chief inorganic substance is calcium phosphate, which is responsible for the bone&#39;s hardness. If the organic portion were burned out the bone would crumble under the slightest pressure. In the formation of intramembraneous bone, certain cells of the embryonic connective tissue congregate in the area where the bone is to form. Small blood vessels soon invade the area, and the cells, which have clustered in strands, undergo certain changes to become osteoblasts. The cells then begin secreting collagen fibers and an intercellular substance. This substance, together with the collagen fibers and the connective tissue fibers already present, is called osteoid. Osteoid is very soft and flexible, but as mineral salts are deposited it becomes hard matrix. The formation of endochondral bone is preceded by the formation of a cartilaginous structure similar in shape to the resulting bone. In a long bone, ossification begins in the area that becomes the center of the shaft. In this area, cartilage cells become osteoblasts and start forming bone tissue This process spreads toward either end of the bone. The only areas where cartilage is not soon replaced by bone tissue are the regions where the shaft joins the two epiphyses. These areas, called epiphyseal pla-res, are responsible for the bones continuing growth in length. The bone&#39;s growth in diameter is due to the addition of layers of bone around the outside of the shaft As they are formed, layers of bone on the inside of the shaft are removed. In all bones, the matrix is arranged in layers called lamellae. In compact bone, the lamellae are arranged concentrically around blood vessels, and the space containing each blood vessel is called a Haver-sian canal. The osteocytes are located between the lamellae, and the canaliculi containing their cellular extensions connect with the Haversian canals, allowing the passage of nutrients and other materials between the cells and the blood vessels. Bone tissue contains also many smaller blood vessels that extend from the periosteum and enter the bone through small openings. In long bones there is an additional blood supply, the nutrient artery, which represents the chief blood supply to the marrow. The structure of spongy is similar to that of compact bone. However, there are fewer Haversian canals, and the lamellae are arranged in a less regular fashion, forming spicules and strands known as trabeculae.</span></p><div class="fb2-subtitle" style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 27px;"><span style="font-size:20px">New words</span></div><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">bone &ndash; кость</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">internal &ndash; внешний</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">phosphorus &ndash; фосфор</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">atrophy &ndash; атрофия</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">spongy &ndash; губчатый</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">tendon &ndash; сухожилие</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">ligament &ndash; связка</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">flexible &ndash; гибкий</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">periosteum &ndash; надкостница</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">osteoblast &ndash; остеобласт (клетка, образующая кость)</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">rigidity &ndash; неподвижность</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">shape &ndash; форма</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">to crumble &ndash; крошиться</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">to congregate &ndash; собираться</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">epiphyseal &ndash; относящийся к эпифизу</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">shaft &ndash; ствол, тело (длинной) кости, диафиз</span></p>
