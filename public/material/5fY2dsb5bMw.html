<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">A tissue is a group of cells working together to do a special job A histologist is one who specializes in the study of tissues. The cells, of which the tissues are made, contain from 60 to 99&nbsp;% water. Chemical reactions that are necessary for proper body function are carried on much more readily in a water solution. The water solution and other materials in which the tissues are bathed is slightly salty. It must be mentioned that an insufficiency of tissues fluid is called dehydration and an abnormal accumulation of this fluid caused a condition called edema.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Tissue classification: The 4 main groups of tissues are:</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">1)&nbsp;epithelial tissue forms elands, covers surfaces and lines cavities;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">2)&nbsp;connective tissue holds all parts of the body in Place. This can be fat, cartilage, bone or blood. Blood sometimes is considered a sort of tissue, since it contains cells and performs many of the functions of tissues. However; the blood has many other unique characteristics;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">3)&nbsp;nerve tissue conducts nerve impulses all over the body;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">4)&nbsp;the muscle tissue is designed for power-producing contractions.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">The surface of the body and of the tubes or passages leading to the exterior and the surface of the various cavities in the body are lined by cells which are closely approximated to each other; thus have a small amount of intercellular substance. This lining cellular layer is called epithelium. The nature and consistency of intercellular substance, the matrix, and the amount and arrangement of fibers furnish the basis for the subdivision of connective tissue into three main groups: connective tissue proper, cartilage and bone In connective tissue the intercellular substance is soft; in cartilage it is firm, yet flexible and elastic; in bone it is rigid due to the deposition of calcium salt in the matrix. In multicellular organisms certain cells developed to a high degree the properties of irritability and conductivity. These cells form the nervous tissues.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">The nervous system of higher animals is characterized by the multiplicity of cellular forms and intercellular connections and by the complexity of its functioning.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Muscle tissue is composed of elongated cells which have the power of contracting or reducing their length. This property of contraction is ultimately a molecular phenomenon and is due to the presence of protein molecules. The following three types of muscle tissue occur in the body.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Smooth muscle tissue is found in sheet or tubes forming the walls of many hollow or tubular organs, for example the bladder, the intes tines of blood vessels. The cells forming this tissue are long spin dles with a central oval nucleus.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Striated muscle tissue is composed of cylindrical fibres often of great at length in which separate cells cannot be distinguished. Many small nuclei are found in the fibres lie just under the surface. Cardiac muscle resembles striated muscle in its structure, but smooth one in its action.</span></p><div class="fb2-subtitle" style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 27px;"><span style="font-size:20px">New words</span></div><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">liquid &ndash; жидкость</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">epithelial &ndash; эпителиальный</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">layer &ndash; слой</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">muscle &ndash; мышца</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">body &ndash; тело</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">flexible &ndash; гибкий</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">elastic &ndash; эластичный</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">nucleus &ndash; ядро</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">smooth &ndash; гладкий</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">fibre &ndash; волокно</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">cardiac &ndash; сердечный</span></p>
