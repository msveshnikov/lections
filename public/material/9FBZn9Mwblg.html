<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Leukocytes, or white blood cells, are primarily with the cellular and humoral defense of the organism foreign materials. Leukocytes are classified as granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and agranulocytes (lympmonocytes).</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Granulocytes are named according to the staining properties of their specific granules. Neutrophils sare 10&ndash;16 mm in diameter.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">They have 3&ndash;5 nuclear lobes and contain azurophilic granules (lysosomes), which contain hydrolytic enzymes for bacterial destruction, in their cytoplasm. Neutrophils are phagocytes that are drawn (chemotaxis) to bacterial chemoattractants. They are the primary cells involved in the acute inflammatory response and represent 54&ndash;62&nbsp;% of leukocytes.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Eosinophils: they have a bilobed nucleus and possess acid granulations in their cytoplasm. These granules contain hydrolytic enzymes and peroxidase, which a discharged into phagocytic vacuoles.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Eosinophils are more numerous in the blood during allergic diseases; they norma asent only &ndash; 3&nbsp;% of leukocytes.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Basophils: they possess large spheroid granules, which are basophilic and metachromatic</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Basophils degranulate in certain immune reaction, releasing heparin and histamine into their surroundings They also release additional vasoactive amines and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) consisting of leu-kotrienes LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. They represent less than 1&nbsp;% &ndash; of leukocytes</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Agranulocytes are named according to their lack of specific granules. Lymphocytes are generally small cells measuring 7 &ndash; 10 mm in diameter and constitute 25&ndash;33&nbsp;% of , leukocytes. They con tain circular dark-stained nuclei and scanty clear blue cyto plasm. Circulating lymphocytes enter the blood from the lymphatic tissues. Two principal types of immunocompetent lymphocytes can be identified T lymphocytes and В lymphocytes.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">T cells differentiate in the thymus and then circulate in the peripheral blood, where they are the principal effec tors of cell-mediated immunity. They also function as helper and suppressor cells, by modulating the immune response through their effect on В cells, plasma cells, macrophages, and other T Cells.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">В cells differentiate in bone marrow. Once activated by contact with an antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells, which synthesize antibodies that are secreted into the blood, intercellular fluid, and lymph. В lymphocytes also give rise to memory cells, which differentiate into plas ma cells only after the second exposure to the antigen. Monocytes vary in diameter from 15&ndash;18 mm and are the largest of the peripheral blood cells. They constitute 3&ndash;7&nbsp;% of leukocytes.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Monocytes possess an eccentric nucleus. The cytoplasm has a ground-glass appearance and fine azurophilic granules.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Monocytes are the precursors for members of the mo-nonuclear phagocyte system, including tissue macrophages (histiocytes), osteoclasts, alveolar macrophages, and Kupffer cells of the liver.</span></p><div class="fb2-subtitle" style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 27px;"><span style="font-size:20px">New words</span></div><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">mesodermal &ndash; мезодермальный</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">erythrocytes &ndash; эритроциты</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">leukocytes &ndash; лейкоциты</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">fibrous proteins &ndash; волокнистые белки</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">immune &ndash; иммунный</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">humoral &ndash; гуморальный</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">to contain &ndash; содержать</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">nuclei &ndash; ядра</span></p>
